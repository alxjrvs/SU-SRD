        "value": "The 'TAC-OS PATTERN' Cerberus is a colossal multi-headed Automech, the pinnacle of the Automech Program. Designed by TJG Automations, it features three independently controlled heads - Kyrios, Phren, and Morphos - each capable of mounting separate weapon systems and modules. The advanced Tac-OS A.I. system was the only system powerful enough to control all three heads simultaneously, though the chassis can also be piloted by three separate Pilots, one for each head."
