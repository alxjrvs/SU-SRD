It can be detected by scanners, probing, or careful searching, and by throwing small items. It can usually be pushed through with one Mech movement, but some are larger. Exposed Pilots are reduced to 0 HP, must roll on the Critical Injury Table, and die if they remain for over a minute. Mechs must roll on the Critical Damage Table each turn spent in the anomaly."

Pilots drawn in take 2 HP damage and suffer a Major Injury from being slammed. Mechs can usually avoid the force, but passing through it risks a random Scrap, System, or Module in their cargo bay being sucked in and damaged. Retrieving it risks 1 SP damage from debris."

When a Mech or Vehicle enters, a random System or Module transforms into another random System or Module of its Tech Level or lower over the next hour.
